Every cartridge is identified by its name.\n\nBy default, the `case_version`, `subscription_channel` and `version` properties are retrieved using **olm-utils** using the `cp4d_version` property at the `cp4d` level.

For example: both Watson Studio (ws) and Watson Knowledge Catalog (wkc) use the Common Core Services (ccs). If you choose to override the version for ws, the ccs version installed may not be compatible with wkc.\n</InlineNotification>\n\n\nSome cartridges may require additional information to correctly install or to create an instance for the cartridge.
