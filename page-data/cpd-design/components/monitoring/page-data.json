The observations generated by Cloud Pak for Data are pushed to the OpenShift Monitoring Prometheus endpoint. This will allow (external) monitoring tools to combine the observations from the OpenShift platform and Cloud Pak for Data from a single source. \n\n![Monitoring overview](cloud-pak-deployer-monitors.png)\n\nTo deploy Cloud Pak for Data Monitors, its is mandatory to enable the OpenShift monitoring. OpenShift monitoring is activated via the `openshift_monitoring` object. For Cloud Pak for Data to be able to push its Prometheus metrics to OpenShift monitoring, the `user_worload` must be set to enabled. To make the openShift monitoring data persistent, the (optional) setting `pvc_storage_class` and `pvc_storage_size_gb` can be set. To enable Prometheus RemoteWrite, use the `remote_rewrite_url`. By default, the OpenShift Container Platform monitoring stack configures the retention time for Prometheus data to be 15 days. You can modify the retention time to change how soon the data is deleted using the optional `retention_period` property. The value is set with a number directly followed by ms (milliseconds), s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks), or y (years).\n\nOptionally it is possible to install the community operator of Grafana, which provides the ability to build your own Grafana Dashboards. The `grafana_project` specifies the OpenShift project in which Grafana is deployed. The installation of Grafana creates a default local administrative user with username `root` and password `secret`. Grafana can be accessed via the OpenShift Route that is exposed in the `grafana_project`.\n\n```\nopenshift_monitoring:\n- openshift_cluster_name: pluto-01\n  user_workload: enabled\n  remote_rewrite_url: http://www.example.com:1234/receive\n  retention_period: 15d\n  pvc_storage_class: ibmc-vpc-block-retain-general-purpose\n  pvc_storage_size_gb: 100\n  grafana_operator: enabled\n  grafana_project: grafana\n```\n\nThe observations of Cloud Pak for Data are generated using the zen-watchdog component, which is part of the cpd_platform cartridge and therefore available on each instance of Cloud Pak for Data.
